Data files for CpG Islands, shelves and shores

Generated by cpg_islands_shores_and_shelves.sh

CpG shores and shelves are defined as in standard literature. See for example [DNA methylation of shelf, shore and open sea CpG positions distinguish high microsatellite instability from low or stable microsatellite status colon cancer stem cells](https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/full/10.2217/epi-2018-0153)

More formally (including edge cases related to shore, shelf and island overlaps):

- Shelves are 2kb upstream and downstream from CpG Islands
- Shores are 2kb upstream and downstream from CpG Shelves (2 to 4 kb from CpG Islands)
- any shelf region that overlaps another island is not a shelf but an island
- any shore region that overlaps another island or shelf is not a shore, but an island or shelf

There are two versions of shore/shelf files:
1. standard versions keep the partial shore/shelf regions that overlap (bedtools subtract logic)
2. full2k only keeps the shores/shelves that are not overlapping another feature at all

Bed files containing all types of features are also provided.

_Note: regions are filtered for chrmosomes 1-22, X, Y and M of hg38 (filtering out unlocalised chromosome fragments of the genome_
